This condition in the Singles class:
	other.desirability >= @sought_desirability || other.desirability > avg_desirability_other_singles
some people duplicated in the Zin class, replacing 
	other.desirability 
with
	other.desirability + num_of_common_hobbies(other)

Some noticed this duplication (well done!), and avoided it e.g. by adding an additional argument to the match method, which is a bit clumsy.

A better solution to this is what you'll see in the sample solution. The method
	perceived_desirability
is how one single perceives the desirability of another. The default implementation in Single is simply
	other.desirability
This definition is correct for Aga as well. In Zin, we override perceived_desirability this way:
	super + num_of_common_hobbies(other)
	
It's worthwhile studying this as it's a nice use of overriding (refinement actually) to avoid code duplication.
